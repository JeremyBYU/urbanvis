# Urban Vis

This project demonstrates how one can construct a three dimensional world using QGIS. It also comes with a custom script script that allows you import 3D models and script
'cinematrograhy' scenarios, allowing one to control the camera and the environment.  The specific scenario presented is for a UAS failure.


## Cinematography Scripting


## Dolly In
## Sweep Around
## Focos on other buildings



# Script (in Words)

* We start off with a full view of the city and all the buildings (all same color)
* We then slowly zoom into the quad rotor. We see the amazon package
* We give it a malfunction by providing an exclamation symbol
* We do a full 360 sweep around it looking at possible visible landing positions
* We remove the exclamation symbol and add the database.  Like an upgrade, or superpowers
* We zoom out and see all available positions, database is shows you the parks and such
* We then show the colors for valid roof top landings
* Draw paths to a select few landing sites (blue)
* Highlight the best Path Green!
